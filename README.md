#  Flood Detection - Finetuned Model

This project focuses on finetuning an existing deep learning model for **flood detection** using satellite imagery. It was developed for a **private competition**.
This is **not original model code** — the work centers around finetuning and optimization.

## Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle:

[ Flood Detection Dataset by phmc2511](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phmc2511/hehehe)

- Satellite images labeled for flood vs non-flood conditions
- Preprocessed for input into a deep learning pipeline

##  Model & Training

- Base model: *(please specify — e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet, etc.)*
- Finetuned on the provided dataset using transfer learning
- Achieved **0.929 private leaderboard score**

##  Notes

    This was developed during a private competition.

    For educational or research use only.
