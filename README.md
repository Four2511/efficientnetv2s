# Flood Detection - Finetuned Model

This project focuses on finetuning an existing deep learning model for **flood detection** using satellite imagery.  
It was developed for a **private competition**. 
This is **not original model code** â€” the work centers around **finetuning, data expansion**, and **optimization**.

##  Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[Flood Detection Dataset by phmc2511](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phmc2511/hehehe)

- Most of the data was sourced from Kaggle
- Additional data was added and augmented to improve performance
- Satellite images are labeled for flood vs non-flood conditions
- Preprocessed for input into a deep learning pipeline

##  Model & Training
- Finetuned using transfer learning
- Trained with standard techniques: augmentations, LR tuning, early stopping
- Achieved **0.929** on the private leaderboard

##  Notes

- Developed as part of a private competition
- Focused on **finetuning and data strategy**, not model architecture
- For **educational or research use only**
